# Dotfiles

Glad you're interested in my dotfiles! I use them a lot!

It's definiately an active work in progress, as I'm constantly playing with how to best spin up new systems, or adding on new shortcuts. I'm not opposed to pull requests, or new ideas, but this repo is very fresh and very beta, so good luck. Feel free to tweet me, @jacobnollette


I started keeping track of different OSes and version numbers, so that I could better manage older systems. It's kind of a pain in the butt, and it may change, or improve.


I mostly use OS X 10.11 El Cap, and Ubuntu LTSes (16.04, 14.04).


Cheers,
Jacob
