# dotfiles
Glad you're interested in my dotfiles!
This is definitely a work in progress. Feel free to hit me up if you have any feedback.

From the start, I am guessing this will be a bit more involved and complicated than the typical dotfiles repo. Normally I see dotfiles with just the basics that live in the home folder, to taylor your setup for things like vim or tmux. You can expect that, but also I am probably going to try to write some automation, or document some build processes. Ideally I will probably find something like puppet, of cheff, or vagrant useful, but for now, I am going to focus on documenting some of the good stuff.

Also it should be mentioned, I mostly use OS X, and Ubuntu or Debian.


Chears,
Jacob
